# Platypus-in-12: The termination puzzle game
This is a small program I wrote in an investigative report for a computing subject at RMIT. It involves the platypus game, a teaching tool in the course 'Computing Theory', I made my own spin of this game in a couple of days.

## Build
Use the makefile, if not `g++ -Ofast platypus.cpp -o platypus` and then `./platypus` should work.

## How to play
The game generates, what is essentially a Turing Machine, and you must create a tape to have it terminate as quickly as possible. The score is out of 100.
